        <h1 id="feminist-manifesto">Feminist Manifesto</h1>
        
        <p>The feminist movement as at present instituted is<br />
        <strong>Inadequate</strong></p>
        
        <p><em>Women</em> if you want to realize yourselves-you are on the<br />
        eve of a devastating psychological upheaval-all your pet illu-<br />
        sions must be unmasked<strong class="dashes">—</strong>the lies of centuries have got to go<strong class="dashes">—</strong><br />
        are you prepared for the <em>Wrench</em><strong class="dashes">—</strong>? There is no half-<br />
        measure<strong class="dashes">—</strong>NO scratching on the surface of the rubbish heap<br />
        of tradition, will bring about <em>Reform</em>, the only method is<br />
        <em>Absolute</em> <em>Demolition</em></p>
        
        <p>Cease to place your confidence in economic legislation, vice-<br />
        crusades &amp; uniform education-you are glossing over<br />
        <em>Reality</em>.<br />
        Professional &amp; commercial careers are opening up for you<strong class="dashes">—</strong><br />
        <strong>Is</strong> <strong>that</strong> <strong>all</strong> <strong>you</strong> <strong>want</strong> <em class="large no-underline">?</em></p>
        
        <p>And if you honestly desire to find your level without preju-<br />
        dice<strong class="dashes">—</strong>be <strong>Brave</strong> &amp; deny at the outset<strong class="dashes">—</strong>that pa-<br />
        thetic clap-trap war cry <strong>Woman</strong> <strong>is</strong> <strong>the</strong><br />
        <strong>equal</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>man</strong><strong class="dashes">—</strong></p>
        
        <p>                                    for<br />
        She is <strong>NOT</strong><em class="large no-underline">!</em></p>
        
        <p>The man who lives a life in which his activities conform to a<br />
        social code which is protectorate of the feminine element<strong class="dashes">—</strong><br />
        is no longer <em>masculine</em><br />
        The women who adapt themselves to a theoretical valuation of<br />
        their sex as a <em>relative</em> <em>impersonality</em>, are not yet<br />
        <em>Feminine</em><br />
        Leave off looking to men to find out what you are <em>not</em> <strong class="dashes">—</strong>seek<br />
        within yourselves to find out what you <em>are</em><br />
        As conditions are at present constituted<strong class="dashes">—</strong>you have the choice<br />
        between <strong>Parasitism</strong><strong class="large no-underline">, &amp;</strong> <strong>Prostitu-</strong><br />
        <strong>tion</strong><em class="big no-underline"><strong class="dashes">—</strong>or</em> <em>Negation</em></p>
        
        <p>Men &amp; women are enemies, with the enmity of the exploited<br />
        for the parasite, the parasite for the exploited<strong class="dashes">—</strong>at present they<br />
        are at the mercy of the advantage that each can take of the<br />
        others sexual dependence<strong class="dashes">—</strong>. The only point at which the<br />
        interests of the sexes merge<strong class="dashes">—</strong>is the sexual embrace.</p>
        
        <p>The first illusion it is to your interest to demolish is the<br />
        division of women into two classes    <em>the mistress</em><em class="large no-underline">,</em><br />
        <em class="large no-underline">&amp;</em> <em>the mother</em> every well-balanced &amp; developed woman<br />
        knows that is not true, Nature has endowed the complete<br />
        functions<strong class="dashes">—</strong>there are <em>no</em> <em>restrictions</em> on the woman who is<br />
        so incompletely evolved as to be un-self-conscious in sex, will<br />
        prove a restrictive influence on the temperamental expansion<br />
        of the next generation; the woman who is a poor mistress will<br />
        be an incompetent mother<strong class="dashes">—</strong>an inferior mentality<strong class="dashes">—</strong>&amp; will<br />
        enjoy an inadequate apprehension of <strong>Life</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>To obtain results you must make sacrifices &amp; the first &amp;<br />
        greatest sacrifice you have to make is of your ”virtue”<br />
        The fictitious value of a woman as identified with her physical<br />
        purity<strong class="dashes">—</strong>is too easy to stand-by<del>      </del> rendering her lethargic in<br />
        the acquisition of intrinsic merits of character by which she<br />
        could obtain a concrete value<strong class="dashes">—</strong>therefore, the fist self-<br />
        enforced law for the female sex, as a protection against the<br />
        man made bogey of virtue<strong class="dashes">—</strong>which is the principal instrument<br />
        of her subjection, would be the <small>unconditional</small> surgical<br />
        <small>destruction</small> <small>of</small> <small>virginity</small> through-out the female population at<br />
        puberty<strong class="dashes">—</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>The value of man is assessed entirely according to his use or<br />
        interest to the community, the value of woman depends<br />
        entirely on <small>chance</small>, her success or insuccess in maneouvering<br />
        a man into taking the life-long responsibility of her<strong class="dashes">—</strong><br />
        The advantages of marriage are too ridiculously ample<strong class="dashes">—</strong><br />
        compared to all other trades<strong class="dashes">—</strong>for under modern conditions a<br />
        woman can accept preposterously luxurious support from a<br />
        man (with-out the return of an sort<strong class="dashes">—</strong>even offspring)<strong class="dashes">—</strong>as a thank<br />
        offering for her virginity<br />
        The woman who has not succeeded in striking that<br />
        advantageous bargain<strong class="dashes">—</strong>is prohibited from any but <br />
        surreptitious re-action to Life-stimuli<strong class="dashes">—</strong><em class="big no-underline">&amp;</em> <em>entirely</em><br />
        <em>debarred</em> <strong>maternity.</strong><br />
        Every woman has a right to maternity<strong class="dashes">—</strong><br />
        Every woman of superior intelligence should realize her race-<br />
        responsibility, in producing children in adequate proportion to<br />
        the unfit or degenerate members of her sex<strong class="dashes">—</strong></p>
        
        <p>Each child of a superior woman should be the result of a<br />
        definite period of psychic development in her life<strong class="dashes">—</strong>&amp; and not<br />
        necessarily of a possible irksome &amp; outworn continuance of an<br />
        alliance<strong class="dashes">—</strong>spontaneously adapted for vital creation in the<br />
        beginning but not necessarily harmoniously balanced as the<br />
        parties to it<strong class="dashes">—</strong>follow their individual lines of personal<br />
        evolution<strong class="dashes">—</strong><br />
        For the harmony of race, each individual should be the<br />
        expression of an easy &amp; ample interpenetration of the male &amp;<br />
        female temperaments<strong class="dashes">—</strong>free of stress<br />
        Woman must become more responsible for the child than<br />
        man<strong class="dashes">—</strong><br />
        Woman must destroy in themselves, the desire to be loved<strong class="dashes">—</strong><br />
        The feeling that it is a personal insult when a man transfers<br />
        his attention from her to another woman<br />
        The desire for comfortable protection instead of an intelligent<br />
        curiosity &amp; courage in meeting &amp; resisting the pressure of life<br />
        sex or so called love must be reduced to its initial element,<br />
        honour, grief, sentimentality, pride and &amp; consequently jealousy<br />
        must be detached from it.<br />
        Woman for her happiness must retain her deceptive fragility of<br />
        appearance, combined with indomitable will, irreducible<br />
        courage, &amp; abundant health the outcome of sound nerves<strong class="dashes">—</strong><br />
        Another great illusion is that woman must use all her<br />
        introspective and clear-sightedness &amp; unbiassed bravery to<br />
        destroy<strong class="dashes">—</strong>for the sake of her <small>self</small> <small>respect</small> is the impurity of sex<br />
        the realization in defiance of superstition that there is <small>nothing</small><br />
        <small>impure</small> <small>in</small> <small>sex</small><strong class="dashes">—</strong>except in the mental attitude to it<strong class="dashes">—</strong>will <br />
        constitute an incalculable &amp; wider social regeneration than it<br />
        is possible for our generation to imagine.</p>
