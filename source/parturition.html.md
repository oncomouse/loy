# Parturition

I am the centre  
Of a circle of pain  
Exceeding its boundaries in every direction  
  
The business of the bland sun  
Has no affair with me  
In my congested cosmos of agony  
From which there is no escape  
On infinitely prolonged nerve-vibrations  
Or in contraction  
To the pinpoint nucleus of being

Locate an irritation<span id="s3-l1"></span>without  
It is<span id="s3-l2"></span>within  
<span id="s3-l3"></span>Within  
It is without   
The sensitized area  
Is identical<span id="s3-l6"></span>with the extensity  
Of intension

I am the false quantity  
In the harmony of physiological potentiality  
To which  
Gaining self-control  
I should be consonant  
In time

Pain is no stronger than the resisting force  
Pain calls up in me  
The struggle is equal

The open window is full of a voice  
A fashionable portrait painter  
Running upstairs to a woman’s apartment  
Sings  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;All the girls are tid&rsquo;ly did&rsquo;ly  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the girls are nice  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether they wear their hair in curls  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or **—**{: .dashes}&rdquo;  
At the back of the thoughts to which I permit crystallization  
The conception&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brute  
Why?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The irresponsibility of the male  
Leaves woman her superior Inferiority.  
He is running upstairs

I am climbing a distorted mountain of agony  
Incidentally with the exhaustion of control  
I reach the summit  
And gradually subside into anticipation of  
Repose  
Which never comes.  
For another mountain is growing up  
Which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goaded by the unavoidable  
I must traverse  
Traversing myself

Something in the delirium of night hours  
Confuses while intensifying sensibility  
Blurring spatial contours  
So aiding elusion of the circumscribed  
That the gurgling of a crucified wild beast  
Comes from so far away  
And the foam on the stretched muscles of a mouth  
Is no part of myself  
There is a climax in sensibility  
When pain surpassing itself  
Becomes exotic  
And the ego succeeds in unifying the positive and negative
&nbsp;&nbsp;poles of sensation  
Uniting the opposing and resisting forces  
In lascivious revelation

Relaxation  
Negation of myself as a unit  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacuum interlude  
I should have been emptied of life  
Giving life  
For consciousness in crises&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;races  
Through the subliminal deposits of evolutionary processes

Have I not  
Somewhere  
Scrutinized  
A dead white feathered moth  
Laying eggs?  
A moment  
Being realization  
Can  
Vitalized by cosmic initiation  
Furnish an adequate apology  
For the objective  
Agglomeration of activities  
Of a life  
LIFE  
A leap with nature  
Into the essence  
Of unpredicted Maternity  
Against my thigh  
Tough of infinitesimal motion  
Scarcely perceptible  
Undulation  
Warmth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moisture  
Stir of incipient life  
Precipitating into me  
The contents of the universe  
Mother I am  
Identical  
With infinite Maternity  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indivisible  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acutely  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am absorbed  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into  
The was**—**{: .dashes}is**—**{: .dashes}ever**—**{: .dashes}shall**—**{: .dashes}be  
Of cosmic reproductivity

Rises from the subconscious  
Impression of a cat  
With blind kittens  
Among her legs  
Same undulating life-stir  
I am that cat

Rises from the sub-conscious  
Impression of small animal carcass  
Covered with blue bottles  
**—**{: .dashes}Epicurean**—**{: .dashes}  
And through the insects  
Waves that same undulation of living  
Death  
Life  
I am knowing  
All about  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfolding

The next morning  
Each woman-of-the-people  
Tiptoeing the red pile of the carpet  
Doing hushed service  
Each woman-of-the-people  
Wearing a halo  
A ludicrous little halo  
Of which she is sublimely unaware

I once heard in a church  
**—**{: .dashes}Man and woman God made them**—**{: .dashes}  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank God.
