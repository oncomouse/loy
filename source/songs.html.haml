	# Songs to Joannes
	
	## I
	
	Spawn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fantasies  
	Silting the appraisable  
	Pig Cupid&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his rosy snout  
	Rooting erotic garbage  
	&ldquo;Once upon a time&rdquo;  
	Pulls a weed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;white and star-topped  
	Among wild oats&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sewn in mucous-membrane
	
	I would&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eye in a bengal light  
	Eternity in a sky-rocket  
	Constellations in an ocean  
	Whose rivers run no fresher  
	Than a trickle of saliva
	
	These&nbsp;&nbsp;are suspect places 
	
	I must live in my lantern  
	Trimming subliminal flicker  
	Virginal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the bellows  
	Of Experience  
	<span id="s1-l18"></span>Coloured&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;glass
	
	## II
	
	<span id="s2-l1"></span>The skin-sack  
	In which a wanton duality  
	Packed  
	All the completions of my infructuous impulses  
	Something the shape of a man
	
	To the casual vulgarity of the merely observant  
	More of a clock-work mechanism  
	Running down against time  
	To which I am not paced  
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My finger-tips are numb from fretting your hair  
	A God's door-mat  
	<span id="s2-l12"></span>On the threshold of your mind
	
	## III
	
	We might have coupled  
	In the bed-ridden monopoly of a moment  
	Or broken flesh with one another  
	A t the profane communion table  
	Where wine is spill't on promiscuous lips  
	We might have given birth to a butterfly  
	With the daily-news  
	Printed in blood on its wings
	
	## IV
	
	Once in a mezzanino  
	The starry ceiling  
	Vaulted an unimaginable family  
	Bird-like abortions  
	Wit h human throats  
	A n d Wisdom's eyes  
	Who wore lamp-shade red dresses  
	And woolen hair
	
	One bore a baby  
	In a padded porte-enfant  
	Tied with a sarsanet ribbon  
	To her goose's wings  
	But for the abominable shadows  
	I would have lived  
	Among their fearful furniture  
	T o teach them to tell me their secrets  
	Before I guessed  
	<span class="dashes">—</span>Sweeping the brood clean out
	
	## V
	
	Midnight empties the street  
	Of all but us  
	Three  
	I am undecided which way back  
	<span id="s5-l5"></span>To the left a boy  
	<span class="dashes">—</span>One wing has been washed in the rain  
	The other will never be clean any more<span class="dashes">—</span>  
	Pulling door-bells to remind  
	Those that are snug  
	<span id="s5-l10"></span>To the right a haloed ascetic  
	<span id="s5-l11"></span>Threading houses  
	Probes wounds for souls  
	<span class="dashes">—</span>The poor can't wash in hot water<span class="dashes">—</span>  
	And I dont know which turning to take  
	Since you got home to yourself<span class="dashes">—</span>first
	
	## VI
	
	I know the Wire-Puller intimately  
	And if it were not for the people  
	On whom you keep one eye  
	You could look straight at me  
	And Time would be set back
	
	## VII
	
	My pair of feet  
	Smack the flag-stones  
	That are something left over from your walking  
	The wind stuffs the scum of the white street  
	Into my lungs and my nostrils  
	Exhilarated birds  
	Prolonging flight into the night  
	Never reaching <span class="dashes">— — — — — — —</span>
	
	## VIII
	
	I am the jealous store-house of the candle-ends  
	That lit your adolescent learning  
	<span class="dashes">— — — — — — — — — —</span>  
	Behind God's eyes  
	There might  
	Be other lights
	
	## IX
	
	When we lifted  
	Our eye-lids on Love  
	A cosmos  
	Of coloured voices
	
	And laughing honey  
	And spermatazoa  
	At the core of Nothing  
	In the milk of the Moon
	
	## X
	
	Shuttle-cock and battle-door  
	A little pink-love  
	And feathers are strewn
	
	## XI
	
	Dear one&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at your mercy  
	Our Universe  
	Is only  
	A colorless onion  
	You derobe  
	Sheath by sheath  
	<span id="s11-l9"></span>Remaining  
	A disheartening odour  
	About your nervy hands
	
	## XII
	
	Voices break on the confines of passion  
	Desire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspicion&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woman  
	Solve in the humid carnage
	
	Flesh&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;&nbsp;flesh  
	Draws the inseparable delight  
	Kissing at gasps&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to catch it
	
	Is it true  
	That I have set you apart  
	Inviolate in an utter crystallization  
	Of all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the jolting of the crowd  
	Taught me willingly to live to share
	
	Or are you  
	Only the other half  
	Of an ego's necessity  
	Scourging pride with compassion  
	To the shallow sound of dissonance  
	And boom of escaping breath
	
	## XIII
	
	Come to me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something  
	I have got to tell you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I can't tell  
	Something taking shape  
	Something that has a new name  
	A&nbsp;&nbsp;new&nbsp;&nbsp;dimension  
	A&nbsp;&nbsp;new&nbsp;&nbsp;use  
	A&nbsp;&nbsp;new&nbsp;&nbsp;illusion
	
	It is ambient<span id="s13-l8"></span>And it is in your eyes  
	Something shiny<span id="s13-l9"></span>Something only for you  
	<span id="s13-l10"></span>Something that I must not see
	
	It is in my ears<span id="s13-l11"></span>Something very resonant  
	Something that you must not hear  
	<span id="s13-l13"></span>Something only for me
	
	Let us be very jealous  
	Very suspicious  
	Very conservative  
	Very cruel  
	Or we might make an end of the jostling of aspira­tions  
	Disorb inviolate egos
	
	Where two or three are welded together  
	They shall become god  
	<span class="dashes">— — — — — — —</span>  
	Oh that's right  
	Keep away from me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please give me a push  
	Don't let me understand you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't realise me
	
	Or we might tumble together  
	Depersonalized  
	Identical  
	Into the terrific Nirvana  
	Me you<span class="dashes">&nbsp;&nbsp;—&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>you<span class="dashes">&nbsp;&nbsp;—&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>me 
	
	## XIV
	
	Today  
	Everlasting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apparent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imperceptible  
	To you  
	I bring the nascent virginity of  
	<span class="dashes">—</span>Myself&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the moment  
	
	No love or the other thing  
	Only the impact of lighted bodies  
	Knocking sparks off each other  
	In chaos
	
	## XV
	
	Seldom&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trying for Love  
	Fantasy dealt them out as gods  
	Two or three men&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looked only human
	
	But you alone  
	Superhuman&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apparently  
	I had to be caught in the weak eddy  
	Of your drivelling humanity  
	<span id="s15-l8"></span>To love you most
	
	## XVI
	
	We might have lived together  
	In the lights of the Arno  
	Or gone apple stealing under the sea  
	Or played  
	Hide and seek in love and cob-webs  
	And a lullaby on a tin-pan
	
	And&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;talked till there were no more tongues  
	To talk with  
	And never have known any better 
	
	## XVII
	
	I don't care  
	Where the legs of the legs of the furniture are walk­ing to  
	Or what is hidden in the shadows they stride  
	Or what would look at me  
	If the shutters were not shut
	
	Red&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a warm colour on the battle-field  
	Heavy on my knees as a counterpane  
	Count counter  
	I counted&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fringe of the towel  
	Till two tassels clinging together  
	Le t the square room fall away  
	From a round vacuum  
	Dilating with my breath
	
	## XVIII
	
	Out of the severing   
	Of hill from hill  
	The interim  
	Of star from star  
	The nascent  
	Static  
	Of night
	
	## XIX
	
	Nothing so conserving  
	As cool cleaving  
	Note of the Q&nbsp;&nbsp;H&nbsp;&nbsp;U  
	Clear carving  
	Breath-giving  
	Pollen smelling  
	Space
	
	White telling  
	Of slaking  
	Drinkable  
	Through fingers  
	Running water  
	Grass haulms  
	Grow to
	
	Leading astray   
	Of fireflies  
	Aerial quadrille  
	Bouncing  
	Off one another  
	Again conjoining  
	In recaptured pulses  
	Of light
	
	You too  
	Had something  
	At that time  
	Of a green-lit glow-worm  
	<span class="dashes">— — — — — — —</span>  
	Yet slowly drenched  
	To raylessness  
	In rain
	
	## XX
	
	Let Joy go solace-winged  
	To flutter whom she may concern 
	
	## XXI
	
	I store up nights against you  
	Heavy with shut-flower's nightmares  
	<span class="dashes">— — — — — — — — — —</span>  
	Stack noons  
	Curled to the solitaire  
	Core of the  
	Sun
	
	## XXII
	
	Green things grow   
	Salads  
	For the cerebral  
	Forager's revival
	
	Upon bossed bellies  
	Of mountains  
	Rolling in the sun  
	And flowered flummery  
	Breaks  
	To my silly shoes
	
	In ways without you  
	I go  
	Gracelessly  
	As things go
	
	## XXIII
	
	Laughter in solution  
	Stars in a stare  
	Irredeemable pledges  
	Of pubescent consummations  
	Rot  
	To the recurrent moon  
	Bleach  
	To the pure white  
	Wickedness of pain
	
	## XXIV
	
	The procreative truth of Me  
	Petered out  
	In pestilent  
	Tear drops  
	Little lusts and lucidities  
	And prayerful lies  
	Muddled with the heinous acerbity 
	Of your street-corner smile
	
	## XXV
	
	Licking the Arno  
	The little rosy  
	Tongue of Dawn  
	Interferes with our eyelashes  
	<span class="dashes">— — — — — — — —</span>  
	We twiddle to it  
	Round and round  
	Faster  
	And turn into machines
	
	Till the sun  
	Subsides in shining  
	Melts some of us  
	Into abysmal pigeon-holes  
	Passion has bored  
	In warmth
	
	Some few of us  
	Grow to the level of cool plains  
	Cutting our foot-hold  
	With steel eyes
	
	## XXVI
	
	Shedding our petty pruderies  
	From slit eyes
	
	We sidle up  
	To Nature  
	<span class="dashes">— — —</span> that irate pornographist
	
	## XXVII
	
	Nucleus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing  
	Inconceivable concept  
	Insentient repose  
	The hands of races  
	Drop off from  
	Immodifiable plastic
	
	The contents  
	Of our ephemeral conjunction  
	In aloofness from Much  
	Flowed to approachment of <span class="dashes">— — — —</span>  
	NOTHING  
	There was a man and a woman  
	In the way  
	While the Irresolvable  
	Rubbed with our daily deaths  
	Impossible eyes
	
	## XXVIII
	
	The steps go up for ever  
	And they are white  
	And the first step is the last white  
	Forever
	
	Coloured&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conclusions  
	Smelt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to synthetic  
	Whiteness  
	Of my  
	Emergence  
	And I am burnt quite white  
	In the climacteric  
	Withdrawal of your sun  
	And wills and words all white  
	Suffuse  
	Illimitable monotone
	
	White&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where there is nothing to see  
	But a white towel  
	Wipes the cymophonous sweat  
	<span class="dashes">—</span>Mist rise of living<span class="dashes">—</span>  
	From your  
	Etiolate body  
	And the white dawn  
	Of your New Day  
	Shuts down on me
	
	Unthinkable&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that white over there  
	<span class="dashes">— — —</span> Is smoke from your house 
	
	## XXIX
	
	Evolution&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fall foul of  
	Sexual equality  
	Prettily miscalculate  
	Similitude  
	Unnatural selection  
	Breed such sons and daughters  
	As shall jibber at each other  
	Uninterpretable cryptonyms  
	Under the moon
	
	Give them some way of braying brassily  
	For carressive calling  
	Or to homophonous hiccoughs  
	Transpose the laugh  
	Let them suppose that tears  
	Are snowdrops or molasses  
	Or anything  
	Than human insufficiencies  
	Begging dorsal vertebrae
	
	Let meeting be the turning  
	To the antipodean  
	And Form&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a blurr  
	Anything  
	Than seduce them  
	To the one  
	As simple satisfaction  
	For the other 
	
	Let them clash together  
	From their incognitoes  
	In seismic orgasm  
	For far further  
	Differentiation  
	Rather than watch  
	Own-self distortion  
	Wince in the alien ego
	
	## XXX
	
	In some  
	Prenatal plagiarism  
	Foetal buffoons  
	Caught tricks  
	<span class="dashes">— — — — —</span>
	
	From architypal pantomime  
	Stringing emotions  
	Looped aloft  
	<span class="dashes">— — — —</span>
	
	For the blind eyes  
	That Nature knows us with  
	And the most of Nature&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is green  
	<span class="dashes">— — — — — — — — — —</span>
	
	## XXXI
	
	Crucifixion   
	Of a busy-body  
	Longing to interfere so  
	With the intimacies  
	Of your insolent isolation
	
	Crucifixion  
	Of an illegal ego's  
	Eclosion  
	On your equilibrium  
	Caryatid&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of an idea
	
	Crucifixion  
	Wracked arms  
	Index extremities  
	In vacuum  
	To the unbroken fall
	
	## XXXII
	
	The moon is cold  
	Joannes  
	Where the Mediterranean <span class="dashes">— — — — —</span>
	
	## XXXIII
	
	The prig of passion <span class="dashes">— — — —</span>  
	To your professorial paucity 
	
	Proto-plasm was raving mad  
	Evolving us <span class="dashes">— — —</span>
	
	## XXXIV 

	Love <span class="dashes">— — —</span> the preeminent literateur
