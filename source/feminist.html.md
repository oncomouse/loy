# Feminist Manifesto

The feminist movement as at present instituted is  
**Inadequate**

_Women_ if you want to realize yourselves-you are on the  
eve of a devastating psychological upheaval-all your pet illu-  
sions must be unmasked**—**{: .dashes}the lies of centuries have got to go**—**{: .dashes}  
are you prepared for the _Wrench_**—**{: .dashes}? There is no half-  
measure**—**{: .dashes}NO scratching on the surface of the rubbish heap  
of tradition, will bring about _Reform_, the only method is  
_Absolute_ _Demolition_

Cease to place your confidence in economic legislation, vice-  
crusades & uniform education-you are glossing over  
_Reality_.  
Professional & commercial careers are opening up for you**—**{: .dashes}  
**Is** **that** **all** **you** **want** _?_{:.large .no-underline}

And if you honestly desire to find your level without preju-  
dice**—**{: .dashes}be **Brave** & deny at the outset**—**{: .dashes}that pa-  
thetic clap-trap war cry **Woman** **is** **the**  
**equal** **of** **man****—**{: .dashes}
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for  
She is **NOT**_!_{:.large .no-underline}

The man who lives a life in which his activities conform to a  
social code which is protectorate of the feminine element**—**{: .dashes}  
is no longer _masculine_  
The women who adapt themselves to a theoretical valuation of  
their sex as a _relative_ _impersonality_, are not yet  
_Feminine_  
Leave off looking to men to find out what you are _not_ **—**{: .dashes}seek  
within yourselves to find out what you _are_  
As conditions are at present constituted**—**{: .dashes}you have the choice  
between **Parasitism****, &**{:.large .no-underline} **Prostitu-**  
**tion**_**—**{: .dashes}or_{:.big .no-underline} _Negation_

Men & women are enemies, with the enmity of the exploited  
for the parasite, the parasite for the exploited**—**{: .dashes}at present they  
are at the mercy of the advantage that each can take of the  
others sexual dependence**—**{: .dashes}. The only point at which the  
interests of the sexes merge**—**{: .dashes}is the sexual embrace.

The first illusion it is to your interest to demolish is the  
division of women into two classes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_the mistress_{: }_,_{:.large .no-underline}  
_&_{:.large .no-underline} _the mother_ every well-balanced & developed woman  
knows that is not true, Nature has endowed the complete  
functions**—**{: .dashes}there are _no_ _restrictions_ on the woman who is  
so incompletely evolved as to be un-self-conscious in sex, will  
prove a restrictive influence on the temperamental expansion  
of the next generation; the woman who is a poor mistress will  
be an incompetent mother**—**{: .dashes}an inferior mentality**—**{: .dashes}& will  
enjoy an inadequate apprehension of **Life**.

To obtain results you must make sacrifices & the first &  
greatest sacrifice you have to make is of your ”virtue”  
The fictitious value of a woman as identified with her physical  
purity**—**{: .dashes}is too easy to stand-by<del>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</del> rendering her lethargic in  
the acquisition of intrinsic merits of character by which she  
could obtain a concrete value**—**{: .dashes}therefore, the fist self-  
enforced law for the female sex, as a protection against the  
man made bogey of virtue**—**{: .dashes}which is the principal instrument  
of her subjection, would be the <small>unconditional</small> surgical  
<small>destruction</small> <small>of</small> <small>virginity</small> through-out the female population at  
puberty**—**{: .dashes}.

The value of man is assessed entirely according to his use or  
interest to the community, the value of woman depends  
entirely on <small>chance</small>, her success or insuccess in maneouvering  
a man into taking the life-long responsibility of her**—**{: .dashes}  
The advantages of marriage are too ridiculously ample**—**{: .dashes}  
compared to all other trades**—**{: .dashes}for under modern conditions a  
woman can accept preposterously luxurious support from a  
man (with-out the return of an sort**—**{: .dashes}even offspring)**—**{: .dashes}as a thank  
offering for her virginity  
The woman who has not succeeded in striking that  
advantageous bargain**—**{: .dashes}is prohibited from any but   
surreptitious re-action to Life-stimuli**—**{: .dashes}_&_{:.big .no-underline} _entirely_  
_debarred_ **maternity.**  
Every woman has a right to maternity**—**{: .dashes}  
Every woman of superior intelligence should realize her race-  
responsibility, in producing children in adequate proportion to  
the unfit or degenerate members of her sex**—**{: .dashes}

Each child of a superior woman should be the result of a  
definite period of psychic development in her life**—**{: .dashes}& and not  
necessarily of a possible irksome & outworn continuance of an  
alliance**—**{: .dashes}spontaneously adapted for vital creation in the  
beginning but not necessarily harmoniously balanced as the  
parties to it**—**{: .dashes}follow their individual lines of personal  
evolution**—**{: .dashes}  
For the harmony of race, each individual should be the  
expression of an easy & ample interpenetration of the male &  
female temperaments**—**{: .dashes}free of stress  
Woman must become more responsible for the child than  
man**—**{: .dashes}  
Woman must destroy in themselves, the desire to be loved**—**{: .dashes}  
The feeling that it is a personal insult when a man transfers  
his attention from her to another woman  
The desire for comfortable protection instead of an intelligent  
curiosity & courage in meeting & resisting the pressure of life  
sex or so called love must be reduced to its initial element,  
honour, grief, sentimentality, pride and & consequently jealousy  
must be detached from it.  
Woman for her happiness must retain her deceptive fragility of  
appearance, combined with indomitable will, irreducible  
courage, & abundant health the outcome of sound nerves**—**{: .dashes}  
Another great illusion is that woman must use all her  
introspective and clear-sightedness & unbiassed bravery to  
destroy**—**{: .dashes}for the sake of her <small>self</small> <small>respect</small> is the impurity of sex  
the realization in defiance of superstition that there is <small>nothing</small>  
<small>impure</small> <small>in</small> <small>sex</small>**—**{: .dashes}except in the mental attitude to it**—**{: .dashes}will   
constitute an incalculable & wider social regeneration than it  
is possible for our generation to imagine.
